# Entities and Actions

We organise your system into Home Assistant devices. Open **Settings > Devices & services > Solplanet** to see the devices and their entities.

## What You Will See

Your hardware and firmware determine which entities are available. Home Assistant may also generate different entity IDs if names already exist or you rename an entity.

### Inverter

Use the inverter device to monitor power, production, frequency, temperatures, working hours, errors, and phase or MPPT values. Supported systems also have a **Power** configuration switch.

Turning off **Power** can stop the inverter. Keep this switch away from general-purpose dashboards and automations unless you deliberately need it.

### Battery

Use the battery device to monitor state of charge, state of health, charging or discharging power, current limits, communication status, warnings, and errors.

Common controls include:

- **Work mode**
- **SOC min** and **SOC max**
- **Schedule Input Power** and **Schedule Output Power**
- **Power** and **Sleep**
- **Schedule Configured**

Supported ASW5120-LB-G3 and RV5120-LB-G3 batteries also expose LED colour and brightness controls.

Changing **Power**, **Sleep**, or state-of-charge settings affects battery operation. Test changes while you can observe the system.

### Meter

Use the main meter device to monitor grid power, voltage, current, power factor, and imported or exported energy. On supported V2 systems, the diagnostic **Power limit control** entity shows whether control is **Disabled**, **Limit power**, **Limit current**, or **Zero power**.

A discovered sub-meter may appear as a device without entities. We currently expose live V2 readings and power-limit controls only for the main meter.

We do not create a house-load entity. Calculating house load from inverter, battery, and meter values can be inaccurate when readings arrive at different times or the installation has a different meter topology.

### Dongle

Supported V2 dongles expose network details such as IP address, Wi-Fi signal, and warnings. They can also provide **Sync time** and **Reboot** buttons.

## Actions

We use Home Assistant actions for battery schedules and meter power-limit control. To try one:

1. Open **Developer Tools > Actions**.
2. Search for **Solplanet**.
3. Select an action and complete its fields.
4. Select **Perform action**.

Available actions are:

| Action name | Action ID | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set Schedule Slots | `solplanet.set_schedule_slots` | Add one charge or discharge period |
| Clear Schedule | `solplanet.clear_schedule` | Clear one day or the full schedule |
| Enable power limit control (Limit power) | `solplanet.set_meter_limit_power` | Limit grid export by watts or percentage |
| Enable power limit control (Limit current) | `solplanet.set_meter_limit_current` | Limit inverter grid import and export current |
| Enable power limit control (Zero power) | `solplanet.set_meter_zero_power` | Ask the inverter to avoid grid export |
| Disable power limit control | `solplanet.disable_meter_power_limit` | Return power-limit control to disabled |

For schedule actions, target the battery's **Schedule Configured** entity. For every power-limit action, select the **main meter device** in the **Meter device** field. An inverter, battery, or dongle will be rejected. A sub-meter is not an independent control target and may send the same system-wide setting, so do not select one.

See [Battery Modes and Schedules](Battery-Modes-and-Schedules) and [Power Limit Control](Power-Limit-Control) before using these actions in an automation.

## Dashboards And Automations

Start with a simple dashboard showing inverter power, battery state of charge, battery power, meter power, and any warning or error entities. Observe the sign and behaviour of your own meter values before using them as automation triggers.

Once a manual action works, add the same action to a Home Assistant script or automation. Include an explicit cleanup action when appropriate, such as disabling a temporary export limit at the end of an export window.
