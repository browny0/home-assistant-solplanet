# Solplanet / VoltX Inverter Integration

This custom integration connects Home Assistant directly to a local [Solplanet inverter dongle](https://solplanet.net/au/products/ai-dongle), including compatible [VoltX-branded systems](https://voltxenergy.com.au/). It provides inverter, battery, and grid data alongside supported battery and power controls.

This repository is a fork of the upstream integration by [`zbigniewmotyka`](https://github.com/zbigniewmotyka/home-assistant-solplanet), with a primary focus on **V2 devices and firmware**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> V1 devices have limited support. New features and fixes primarily target V2 systems.

## Features

- Local inverter, battery, meter, and dongle monitoring
- Battery work-mode and state-of-charge controls

## Requirements
